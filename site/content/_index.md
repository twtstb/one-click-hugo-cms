    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

      of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and local
      communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
